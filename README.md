> [!WARNING]
> Please note that if you select "Official server", the launcher will communicate with LevelInfinite's servers. Additionally, you may be banned as this launcher currently does not behave the same way as the official one.

## NOTE
This project is unfinished, especially the user interface. This project is provided "as is", I am not responsible for your account being banned if you choose to use this on the official server.
I started developing this during the start of 2025, but decided to upload the code after working on other projects.

## Usage
[Windows download link](https://nightly.link/EpinelPS/EpinelPSLauncher/workflows/build/master/Launcher_win-x64.zip).

[Linux download link](https://nightly.link/EpinelPS/EpinelPSLauncher/workflows/build/master/Launcher_linux-x64.zip).

Extract the zip file somewhere, and run EpinelPS.Desktop.exe (or EpinelPS.Desktop if on Linux). 

## Features
 - Run the game without any of the original launcher files
 - Download/update the game faster than the official Launcher

## TODO
 - Run the game without anti-linux systems enabled
